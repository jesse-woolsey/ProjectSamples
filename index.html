    <h3><u>Scenario Based Learning: An Instructional Design Process Full Walk-Through</u></h3>   
    <p> <strong> Overview + Purpose:</strong> Following the ADDIE Method, this eLearning experience was designed and developed for use within a sales workforce to solve the problem that stress and emotional responses negatively impact performance and ability to meet performance targets. The learning solution solves this problem by equipping sales reps with breathing exercises for self-regulation during demanding sales calls and workdays.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Audience:</strong> Sales Workforce</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Action Mapping, Brainstorming learning solutions, Instructional Design, eLearning Development, Visual Design, Storyboard, Mockups, Data Analysis</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Articulate Storyline, Mural, Miro, Google Docs, Photopea, GitHub Pages, TalentLMS, and Survey Monkey with open-source resources from Freepik, Pixabay, and flaticon </p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Process:</strong> See below for steps, explanations, and samples tracking the ID process through the ADDIE Method </p></li>

  <div>
    <p><strong> <u>ANALYSIS STAGE</u> - Action Mapping in Mural:</strong><p>
      <ul>
         <li><p><strong>Process:</strong> I imagined inviting key stakeholders from the client‚Äôs organization to investigate the question: ‚ÄúHow can we achieve workplace well-being through elimination of anxiety and stress during sales work?‚Äù Leveraging research and experience in addition to collaborative insights from imagined subject matter experts and sales supervisors, I created an ACTION MAP outlining the specific actions workers need to take during sales work and associated stress and emotions that need to be managed. I then brainstormed and proposed learning solutions, which obtained approval before imitating design work.</p>
           </li>
        <li><p><strong>Tool Used:</strong> Mural</p>

    <p><strong> <u>DESIGN STAGE</u>: Text-Based Storyboard and Collaborative Visual Style Guide:</strong><p>
      <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Process:</strong> After I built a Visual Style Guide, stakeholders were invited to provide feedback. Collaboratively, the team made final design choices by using digital Post-Its as a voting tool.</p>
        </li>
          <li><p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Miro and free-license design files Freepik, Pixabay, Coolors, Flaticon <p>

        <li><p><strong>Process:</strong> A Text-Based Storyboarding was created based on approved content and establishes a character-driven, scenario-based learning experience. Learner actions and practice scenarios reflect requirements determined through previous Action Mapping. Triggers, layer cues, and branching logic were also established to minimize issues during the development phase.</p>

    <p><strong> <u>DEVELOPMENT STAGE</u> - Full development in Articulate Storyline with illustration work in Photopea:</strong><p>
      <ul>
         <li><p><strong>Process:</strong> Work started with creating custom Master Slides with collaboratively chosen color palette, font styles, and button design. The development process in Storyline utilizing triggers, item states, variables, slide layers, and branching scenarios to allow learners the ability to progress through experience based on their own choices. Learners receive immediate, real-world feedback during Scenario Based Quiz questions.  Any additional illustration work for character or design customization was completed through the web-based editing tool Photopea.</p>
