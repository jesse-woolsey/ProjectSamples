  <h3><u>Scenario Based Learning using Articulate Storyline: A Full ID Process Walk-Through</u></h3>   

    <p> <strong>ADDIE Method eLearning Development of Breath/Work:</strong> This eLearning experience was designed and developed for use within a sales workforce with the goal to improve worker‚Äôs emotional self-regulation in order to decrease work anxiety and panic through utilizing breathing exercises </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>Audience:</strong> Sales Workforce</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Responsibilies:</strong> Action Mapping, Brainstorming learning solutions, Instructional Design, eLearning Development, Visual Design, Storyboard, Mockups, Data Analysis</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Articulate Storyline, Mural, Miro, Google Docs, Photopea, GitHub Pages, TalentLMS, and Survey Monkey with open-source resources from Freepik, Pixabay, and flaticon </p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Process:</strong> See below for steps, explanations, and samples tracking the ID process through the ADDIE Method </p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Sample:</strong> Final eLearning Design Project: Breath/Work</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    </div>

    <p><strong> <u>ANALYSIS</u> - Action Mapping in Mural:</strong><p>
      <ul>
         <li><p><strong>Process:</strong> During the analysis phase, I imagined inviting key stakeholders from the client‚Äôs organization to investigate the question: ‚ÄúHow can we achieve workplace well-being through elimination of anxiety and stress during sales work?‚Äù Armed with research and experience with breathing exercise and the input from imagined subject matter experts and sales supervisors, I created an ACTION MAP that outlined the specific actions workers need to take to successfully navigate daily emotions and stress in order to meet the determined goal, then brainstormed some possible learning solutions to be developed.</p>
           </li>
        <li><p><strong>Tool Used:</strong> Mural</p>

      <p><strong> <u>DESIGN</u> - Text-Based Storyboarding in Google Docs and Collaborative Style Development in Miro:</strong><p>
        <ul>
          <li><p><strong>Process:</strong> Ongoing collaboration with stakeholders can be a critical component to succeesful elearning outcomes. Miro allowed stakeholders to add to a Style Board, then utilize digital Post-It notes to vote on deign choices, leading to a collaborative design process.</p>
          </li>
            <li><p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Miro and free-license design items from Freepik, Pixabay, Coolors, Flaticon as well as illustrating and editing through Photopea  <p>
                </li>
            <li><p><strong>Sample:</strong> Collaborative Design Board</p>

          <li><p><strong>Process:</strong> Text-based Storyboarding was utilized to build out content and a character-driven and scenario-based learning experience. Actions and practice scenarios determined during the Action Mapping phase during learnign analysis were foundations of the content. Triggers, queues, and branching logic were also provided to minimize issues during the development phase.</p>
             </li>
          <li><p><strong>Tool Used:</strong> Google Docs</p>

        <p><strong> <u>DEVELOPMENT</u> - Full development in Articulate Storyline and design work in Photopea:</strong><p>
          <ul>
             <li><p><strong>Process:</strong> Leveraging the Text-Based storyboard and Style Guide, a character-driven eLearning Experience was developed in Articulate Storyline. Preliminary development work included the creation of custom Master Slides, including establishing the custom color palette, custom font styles, and custom button design. The development process included using triggers, item states, variables, slide layers, and branching scenarios to allow the user the ability to progress through experience based on their own choices and receive immediate, real-world feedback during Scenario Based Quiz questions.  While the Style guide was created during the Design stage, additional styling work was required for character and design customization, so the web-based illustrator and editing tool Photopea was utilized.</p>
               </li>
           
               <li><p><strong>Tool Used:</strong> Articulate Storyline</p>
              </li>
            <li><p><strong>Sample 1:</strong> Storyline development utilizing triggers, default states, and variables to update slide visuals and represent progress</p>
               </li>
               <img class="sample-image" src="images/StorylineSample1.png" alt="Photo showing Storyline Triggers" />

               <li><p><strong>Sample 2:</strong> Storyline development creating an animated illustration to give a timed visual and textual guide for breathing exercises. Triggeres, animations, and slide layers were utilized to provide visual experience and option for learner to repeat an breathing exercise as needed or to proceed with the eLearning experience</p>
               </li>
               <img class="sample-image" src="images/StorylineSample4.png" alt="Photo showing Storyline Triggers" />



               <li><p><strong>Sample 3:</strong> Storyline development utilizing real-world impact based on the user's correct or incorrect resposne to the given scenario. Additionally, a marker was used as a hiden, optional hint tool</p>
               </li>

          <p><strong> <u> IMPLEMENT & EVALUATE </u> - Launch on LMS, assign to reps, and send 30-Day Feedback Survey</strong><p>
            <ul>
               <li><p><strong>Process:</strong> The Breath/Work eLearning Experience was launched using TalentLMS. Imagined sales representatives were all assigned the course and given a two week window to complete it. Upon completion, management receives reporting on pass/fail rates, allowing for additional coaching or support. Finally, the system automates sending a 30-Day follow up feedback and course evaluation survey created in Survey Monkey. This survey not only requests an evaluation of the course, but insight into how helpful the content has been in their workday as well as a chance to share new ideas to improve future training experiences.</p>
